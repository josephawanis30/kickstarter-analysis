- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Based on Outcome of Launch Date Analysis, year over year it seems that the Months of May & June are the most successful months to Launch the Theater campaign for Plays in which is the goal of Louise, followed by Film and Video.  The rate of success was 111 successful campaigns launched while the failed was 52 and the cancelled was only 3.  The months in which results were the lowest for the campaigns where Oct, Nov, and Dec.  The campaign should be concentrated in the future on certain categories in which the success rate was higher such as Music, Theater, Film, and Video.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Based on the Outcomes of Goal, the campaign has a higher success rate of funding with less or equal to the amounts of $4,999. It might be wiser to cut some expenses of some of the Failed and Unsuccessful campaigns out.  This way the rate of success would be higher and funding goals can be achieved.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The Limitation of the database is that its lacking information on project of the main point of Theater and Plays, in which is the main concertation of the next Kickstart campaign.  The rest of the Data from Different sour of the campaign were irrelevant to the new campaign at hand.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

It would be more helpful to see the full scope of the campaign by Perhaps analyzing the database by Country and states, concentrating on Theater and plays.  Creating a pivot table extracting that database and showing the results of fundraising and in which months & how much should the goal of fundraising be.  Since the best most success came from $4,999 fundraising and less.
